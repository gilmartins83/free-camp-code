Welcome to the freeCodeCamp curriculum

We have thousands of coding lessons to help you improve your skills.

You can earn each certification by completing its 5 final projects.

And yes - all of this is 100% free, thanks to the thousands of campers who donate to our nonprofit.

If you are new to coding, we recommend you start at the beginning.
